# vmw_py

Just some vcenter python scripts and examples. Setting up python on vcsa can be difficult as everythign is restricted and getting gcc compile. 

I am not going to go through the details as every linux distro have various ways to install. Bottom line is, python >2.72, database libraries such as pyscopg2, pymssql, cx_oracle and psutil are required. 


As usual, used on your own risk.
